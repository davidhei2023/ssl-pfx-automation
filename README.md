# SSL to PFX Automation

This project was developed for **Zap.co.il**, a major customer of **TripleC**, to streamline the management and renewal of SSL certificates. With approximately 50 certificates requiring renewal each month, manual handling became inefficient and error-prone. 

To address this challenge, I built an automated solution to:

- Ensure timely renewal of SSL certificates.
- Generate and package certificates in PFX format.
- Minimize human intervention and errors in the process.
- Enhance security and compliance with best practices.

As the team leader, I implemented this simple solution for the entire team to use.

## What I Did and How

### Objectives
The main goal was to simplify the process of renewing and managing SSL certificates for **Zap.co.il**. With over 50 certificates requiring renewal monthly, manual processes posed risks of errors and delays.

### Approach
1. **Analyzing Requirements**: Collaborated with the client to understand their SSL management challenges and tailored a solution that fit their needs.
2. **Developing Automation**: Wrote scripts and configured tools to:
   - Automatically check for expiring certificates.
   - Renew the certificates before expiration.
   - Package the renewed certificates into the PFX format for compatibility.
3. **Integrating Security**: Ensured secure handling of certificate data with proper encryption and compliance measures.
4. **Team Enablement**: Created clear documentation and an easy-to-use workflow for the team, allowing them to leverage the automation without technical bottlenecks.

### Outcome
The solution:
- Reduced manual workload by automating the certificate renewal process.
- Improved reliability by ensuring no certificate expiry.
- Enhanced team productivity and minimized errors.

By automating the certificate lifecycle, we help Zap.co.il maintain uninterrupted secure communication and focus on their core business.
