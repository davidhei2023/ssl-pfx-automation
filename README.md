# SSL PFX Automation

This project was developed for **Zap.co.il**, a major customer of **TripleC**, to streamline the management and renewal of SSL certificates. With approximately 50 certificates requiring renewal each month, manual handling became inefficient and error-prone. 

To address this challenge, we built an automated solution to:

- Ensure timely renewal of SSL certificates.
- Generate and package certificates in PFX format.
- Minimize human intervention and errors in the process.
- Enhance security and compliance with best practices.

By automating the certificate lifecycle, we help Za maintain uninterrupted secure communication and focus on their core business.
